This repository features the library for launching and writing to HMT solidity contracts.

## Installation

We run the following version on Python 3.

### Manual

You need few essential system requirements to successfully install our python package.

#### Debian / Ubuntu

```
build-essential 
libffi
autoconf 
libtool
pkg-config
```

#### macOS

```
automake
pkg-config
libtool

gmp
```

After that the following command should install the package successfully.
```

### Docker

In order to build the image you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your computer.

We have gathered relevant commands in the `bin/` folder.

You can run the project with `bin/prelaunch`.

## Deploying to PyPi

A build will automatically be deployed to PyPi from master if tagged with a version number.  This version number should also match the version in the `setup.py` file.

The tags will need to be pushed via a user that has the proper privileges to master (see the contributors of this repo).  

Versioning should follow the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning methodology and not introduce breaking changes on minor or patch-level changes.
