# HUMAN Escrow Factory Dashboard

This is a readonly dashboard of the [Escrow Factory](https://github.com/humanprotocol/hmt-escrow/blob/master/contracts/EscrowFactory.sol) contract

Escrow Factory is used for grouping Escrows in the blockchain. Everything is happening inside Polygon Mainnet. Other networks will be added later

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
